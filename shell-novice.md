# QUESTION: How many of you have used the shell before?

# Computers do 4 things:
- run programs
- store data
- communicate with each other
- and interact with us

Mostly we interact nowadays using a GUI (graphical interface).  
But we can also use a command interface (CLI) with the shell
We type something in, the computer evaluates it, and prints out something for us to read
This is what the shell does, it's a program that lets us run other programs

The shell has been around a long long time, since the 1960's.  It's survived because it's simple and powerful

- Useful for repetitive tasks and constructing a workflow
- Even comes bundled with a lots of little simple programs
- Important if youâ€™re using something like an HPC cluster

# Our hypothetical example: Nelle the marine biologist
Nelle has collected 1520 samples of marine life from the North Pacific Gyre.  
She wants to run protein assays on each of these samples to measure the relative abundances of 300 different 
proteins.  
The assay machine she's using spits out a text file with one line for each protein.  

She's on a deadline and has to: 
1). Run each sample through the machine, which will take a few weeks
2). Calculate statistics for each of the proteins separately using a program her supervisor wrote called goostat.
3). Compare the statistics for the proteins to each other using goodiff, which her labmate wrote.
4). Write up her results, ideally within a month.  

If she had to run goostat and goodiff by hand she'll have to type in the filenames and click OK 46,370 times.  
Even if she can do this quickly, it will take weeks, and she'll certainly have typeos.  

We're going to explore the shell to get at what she could do instead.
We want to automate the repetitive steps in her workflow so that her computer can do all the work 
while she writes her paper.  
Plus, once she puts a workflow together, she can use it again if she collects more data.



##### 2. Navigating Files and Directories #####

# Setup prompt
PS1='$ ' # (Or PS1="\n\w: \$ ")

# Explain that whoami is a program that is being run and displaying output
whoami 

# Print working directory: find out where we are.  Directory = folder
pwd

# Diagram a Unix filesystem and explain the leading / (root directory). There are 2 meanings for /

ls # Listing the contents of current directory

# Kind of hard to tell what's what (which are folders?).  So we'll add a "flag" (explain flags)
ls -F # Puts a slash after folders

# ls has lots of other options, let's look at the help. man stands for manual
man ls # Windows users: ls --help

# You can move around in man using mouse, or up/down arrows.  Or b and spacebar to move a page.  q to quit

# We can also tell ls to look in a different directory than the current one.
# -F and Desktop are parameters or arguments we're giving to the ls program to tell it how to run
ls -F Desktop

# Hopefully you see the data-shell directory.  If not, put up a red sticky

# Now we can see what's inside our data-shell directory
ls -F Desktop/data-shell

# Instead of just looking, we can change our current directory.  
# Say we want to go to that data directory
cd Desktop # cd stands for change directory
cd data-shell
cd data

# cd doesn't tell us anything back, but we can check using our tools from before, 
# to see that we are in the data directory
pwd
ls -F

# So now let's go back to the data-shell directory.  We can try this
cd data-shell

# Oops, that didn't work.  cd can only see subdirectories inside the one we're in
cd .. # This takes us back.  .. stands for the directory containing this, or the parent

# We're back again
pwd

# We can see this parent directory if we use the -a (all) flag for ls
ls -F -a

# We can also stack multiple flags together like this instead of writing them separately
ls -Fa

# Explain hidden files, eg .bash_profile, .DS_Store, ./ (current directory).

# . and .. don't just belong to cd.  Any program can use them, eg this shows my Desktop:
ls ..

# So ls, cd, and pwd are how we navigate around our filesystem
# What happens if you just type cd and press enter?  Where do you go?  Let's figure it out, 
# and put up a green sticky when you have the answer
# %%%%% Socrative %%%%%

# Takes us back to the home directory
cd
pwd

# Let's go back to the data directory.  This time, we don't need to use 3 separate commands, we can string together
cd Desktop/data-shell/data

# So far, we've been using "relative paths" (explain).  ls and cd are trying to find where we mean

# We could also use "absolute paths" these will work no matter where we are.  Remember that leading / means root?
pwd
cd /Volumes/mickles/Desktop/data-shell

# Some shortcuts:
cd ~/Desktop # Tilda is the same as the user's home directory (/Volumes/mickles for me)
cd - # This takes you to the previous directory you were in, very useful for switching back and forth
